Meta-Transformer
================

This is a code generator that spiders a database and, then uses XSLT to transform the code.

I have used this tool for several years that’s why it’s built in windows forms right now but it works. Right now it’s a little finicky because I just rebuilt the DB connection to use either MS SQL  or Oracle. 

It requires SMO to connect to MS SQL and Oracle.DataAccess to connect to Oracle but those can be downloaded from their respective sites. 

All in all it can get the job done but isn’t ready for prime time.

I will be following up with instructions and posting a guide to the meta structure. 

Thanks,
J.
